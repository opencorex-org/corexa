# Local Development

## Toolchain

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 10+
- Go 1.23+
- Rust stable

## Install

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Common Commands

```bash
pnpm dev
pnpm desktop:dev
pnpm cli:dev
pnpm runtime:dev
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm typecheck
```

## Runtime Validation

```bash
go -C runtime/daemon test ./...
cargo test --manifest-path native/tree-sitter-indexer/Cargo.toml
```

## Desktop Troubleshooting

If Electron is installed but the binary payload is missing, the desktop preflight now attempts an automatic repair before it exits. If you still need to repair it manually:

```bash
pnpm --filter @corexa/desktop run repair:electron
```

If the renderer or local dev server cannot bind to a port, check for environment restrictions, firewall behavior, or local process conflicts.

## Development Expectations

- keep changes scoped
- update docs with architecture changes
- prefer shared contracts over duplicated app-specific logic
